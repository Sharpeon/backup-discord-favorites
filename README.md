# About the project

Discord recently felt like it would be a good idea to limit the favorites to 250, which made me lose most of my gifs...
Luckily for us, the links of the gifs are stored in Discord's local storage until you log off the app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
This is a python script, so you'll need to have python installed, duh.

### Setting up the backup

Before using the Python script you must first setup some stuff

1. Open up Discord and then press `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `I`.
2. Go to the `Application` tab.
